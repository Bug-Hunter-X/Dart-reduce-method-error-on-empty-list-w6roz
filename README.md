# Dart Reduce Method Error on Empty List

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using the `reduce` method in Dart with an empty list. The `reduce` method requires at least one element in the list to operate; otherwise, it throws an error.

The `bug.dart` file contains the code that reproduces the error. The `bugSolution.dart` file provides a solution to handle this scenario gracefully.
